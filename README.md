# Package Frontend

Serves as a visual Web Browser for the [`package-backend`](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/package-backend).

Currently this matches very closely with the design of the original package viewer from upstream Atom.

Although does fully support multiple themes being added on later with a theme switcher.

The Web Browser for Packages is available on [`pulsar-edit.dev`](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/).
